# Objective:
The objective is to develop a career service website. We will be using agile methodologies to complete the project. 

# Project Description:
A career service website that allows employers to post job offers and interested parties to apply for them. It will have three different kinds of users: employers, employees(students) and admins. The users will be able to login into the website using an email and password and a employer and student account will be able to be registered for on a seperate page. Our website will allow employers to post job opportunities and students to apply to them and post their resume on their profile. The profiles of all users will be able to be edited at any time. Employers will be able to delete and edit their listings, and Students will be able to remove their application if they aren't interested in a role anymore. The employers will be able to give to the job opportunites a title and a job description with for example the requirements the students need to have to apply for it. When the students apply for a job, the employers will receive a notification and see the resume they uploaded. They can then accept an interview with them or decline them. If they decide to call the applicant for an interview, a notification will be sent to the student. Admins are essentially moderators of the website and can modify and manage profile information and postings of all other users.
