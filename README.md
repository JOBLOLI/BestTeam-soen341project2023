## Objective:
The objective is to develop a career service website. We will be using agile methodologies to complete the project. 

## Project Description:
A career service website have three different kinds of users: employers, employees(students) and admins. Our website will allow employers to post job opportunities and students to apply to them and post their resume on their profile. Admins are essentially moderators of the website and can modify and manage profile information and postings.
 
## Core features:
Employer : create an account/register, login, browse candidates, add job offers, select candidates that have already applied to an offer for interview 
Student/Candidate: create an account/register, login, create a profile, and upload their resume; browse for job offers; apply for those postings 
Admin: Managing all user profiles and postings
