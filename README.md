 Project Description:
 The objective is to develop a career service website for employers to post jobs and for students to apply to them and post their resume to their profile. We will be using agile methodologies to complete the project. A third kind of users are the admins who can manage all profiles and postings. 
 
 Types of users:
 Employer : create an account/register, login, browse candidates, add job offers, select candidates that have already applied to an offer for interview 
Student/Candidate: create an account/register, login, create a profile, and upload their resume; browse for job offers; apply for those postings 
Admin: Managing all user profiles and postings
